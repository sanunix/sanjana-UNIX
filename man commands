MAN CAL
NAME
     cal, ncal — displays a calendar and the date of Easter

SYNOPSIS
     cal [-31jy] [-A number] [-B number] [-d yyyy-mm] [[month] year]
     cal [-31j] [-A number] [-B number] [-d yyyy-mm] -m month [year]
     ncal [-C] [-31jy] [-A number] [-B number] [-d yyyy-mm] [[month] year]
     ncal [-C] [-31j] [-A number] [-B number] [-d yyyy-mm] -m month [year]
     ncal [-31bhjJpwySM] [-A number] [-B number] [-H yyyy-mm-dd] [-d yyyy-mm]
         [-s country_code] [[month] year]
     ncal [-31bhJeoSM] [-A number] [-B number] [-d yyyy-mm] [year]
      -h      Turns off highlighting of today.

     -J      Display Julian Calendar, if combined with the -o option, display
             date of Orthodox Easter according to the Julian Calendar.

     -e      Display date of Easter (for western churches).
     -j      Display Julian days (days one-based, numbered from January 1).

     -m month
             Display the specified month.  If month is specified as a decimal
             number, appending ‘f’ or ‘p’ displays the same month of the fol‐
             lowing or previous year respectively.

     -o      Display date of Orthodox Easter (Greek and Russian Orthodox
             Churches).

     -p      Print the country codes and switching days from Julian to Grego‐
             rian Calendar as they are assumed by ncal.  The country code as
             determined from the local environment is marked with an asterisk.

     -s country_code
             Assume the switch from Julian to Gregorian Calendar at the date
             associated with the country_code. 

     -w      Print the number of the week below each week column.

     -y      Display a calendar for the specified year. This option is implied
             when a year but no month are specified on the command line.

     -3      Display the previous, current and next month surrounding today.

     -1      Display only the current month. This is the default.

     -A number
             Months to add after. The specified number of months is added to
             the end of the display. This is in addition to any date range
             selected by the -y, -3, or -1 options. For example, “cal -y -B2
             -A2” shows everything from November of the previous year to Feb‐
             ruary of the following year. Negative numbers are allowed, in
             which case the specified number of months is subtracted. For
             example, “cal -y -B-6” shows July to December. And “cal -A11”
             simply shows the next 12 months.
MAN TIME
NAME
       time - run programs and summarize system resource usage

SYNOPSIS
       time   [ -apqvV ] [ -f FORMAT ] [ -o FILE ]
              [ --append ] [ --verbose ] [ --quiet ] [ --portability ]
              [ --format=FORMAT ] [ --output=FILE ] [ --version ]
              [ --help ] COMMAND [ ARGS ]
       -o FILE, --output=FILE
              Write the resource use statistics to FILE instead of to the
              standard error stream.  By default, this overwrites the file,
              destroying the file's previous contents.  This option is useful
              for collecting information on interactive programs and programs
              that produce output on the standard error stream.

       -a, --append
              Append the resource use information to the output file instead
              of overwriting it.  This option is only useful with the `-o' or
              `--output' option.

       -f FORMAT, --format FORMAT
              Use FORMAT as the format string that controls the output of
              time.  See the below more information.
        -p, --portability
              Use the following format string, for conformance with POSIX
              standard 1003.2:
                        real %e
                        user %U
                        sys %S
